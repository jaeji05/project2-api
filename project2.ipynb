      "Joker: Folie à Deux[a] is a 2024 American musical psychological thriller film directed by Todd Phillips from a screenplay he co-wrote with Scott Silver. Loosely based on DC Comics characters, it is the sequel to Joker (2019). The film stars Joaquin Phoenix reprising the title role as Arthur Fleck, with Lady Gaga joining as his love interest Lee Quinzel. Zazie Beetz also reprises her role from the previous film, while Brendan Gleeson and Catherine Keener join the cast. It is produced by Warner Bros. Pictures in association with Joint Effort and was distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures.\n",
      "Joker was conceived as a standalone film, although Warner Bros. intended the film to launch a DC Black film series. Phillips expressed interest in making a sequel, which entered development in June 2022, with Gaga and Beetz joining later that year. Principal photography took place in New York City, Los Angeles, and Belleville, New Jersey, from December 2022 to April 2023.\n",
      "Joker: Folie à Deux premiered at the 81st Venice International Film Festival on September 4, 2024,[8] and was released in the United States on October 4, 2024. It was not well-received by critics; criticism was aimed at the musical numbers and screenplay, though the performances of Phoenix and Gaga were praised. The film has grossed $121 million worldwide against its $200 million budget.\n",

      "Plot[edit]\n",
      "In an animated sequence, the Joker is impersonated by his shadow, who takes his place to perform his singing number for a TV show, and then abandons him on stage half-undressed, before three policemen arrive and beat him.\n",
      "In 1983, Arthur Fleck is in custody at Arkham State Hospital awaiting trial for the crimes he committed two years prior.[b] His lawyer, Maryanne Stewart, plans to argue that Arthur has dissociative identity disorder and that his \"Joker\" personality is responsible for the crimes. At a music therapy session, Arthur meets another patient, Harleen \"Lee\" Quinzel. Lee confides to Arthur that she grew up in the same neighborhood he did, had an abusive father who died in a car crash and was imprisoned after burning down her parents' apartment building. Lee also expresses her admiration for the Joker's crimes and personality.\n",
      "During a film screening, Lee starts a fire. She and Arthur are caught trying to escape, and Arthur is placed in solitary confinement. Lee seemingly visits him at night to say she is being released to avoid his influence but promises to attend his trial, and they have sex. During an interview with television personality Paddy Meyers, Arthur sings to Lee through the television screen, deepening her love for him.\n",
      "On the day of the trial, Assistant District Attorney Harvey Dent calls witnesses who dismiss Arthur's claims of insanity. During a break, Maryanne reveals that Lee was actually a psychiatry student who grew up in the Upper West Side, and her father, a doctor, is alive. Furthermore, she voluntarily committed herself at Arkham, checked herself out, and never burned down an apartment building. When Arthur confronts Lee, she confesses that her lies were an effort to get close to Arthur but also tells him that she is pregnant and has moved into his old apartment building to create a home for them.\n",
      "At the trial the next day, Arthur dismisses Maryanne and represents himself. After bringing Arthur's former co-worker Gary Puddles and neighbor Sophie Dumond to the stand, Dent rests his case. Arthur, visibly affected by Gary’s testimony, offers no defense, although, during his speech, he mentions the Arkham guards negatively. Returning to Arkham, he is taken to the showers room by head guard Jackie Sullivan and two guards, where he is brutally beaten before being brought to his cell partially naked. Ricky, an inmate and friend of Arthur, verbally confronts the guards, resulting in Jackie strangling him to death. Overhearing this, Arthur reminisces about the aftermath of his first kills as Joker.\n",
      "During his closing argument in court the following day, a devastated Arthur renounces his Joker persona, taking full responsibility for his actions. Enraged at this, Lee storms out, and the jury finds Arthur guilty of first-degree murder. As the foreman reads the verdict, a car bomb explodes outside the courthouse, killing and injuring numerous attendees and scarring half of Dent's face. In the chaos, two followers help Arthur escape.\n",
      "Arthur wanders through Gotham and encounters Lee outside his old apartment, but she rejects him for renouncing his Joker persona and admits that the pregnancy was another lie before leaving. The police apprehend Arthur and return him to Arkham. The next day, a young patient approaches Arthur and begins to tell him a joke before repeatedly stabbing Arthur in the stomach. As Arthur bleeds to death, the patient carves a Glasgow smile into his own face while laughing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cast[edit]\n",
      "Joaquin Phoenix (left) and Lady Gaga (right), who respectively play the Joker and Lee\n",
      "Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck / Joker, a mentally ill nihilistic criminal with a clown-inspired persona, formerly an impoverished party clown and aspiring stand-up comedian. Director Todd Phillips said that while the film would venture further into Fleck's psyche, he would not become the \"Clown Prince of Crime\", as his Joker persona is an unwilling symbol to people who give him the love he always wanted.[9]\n",
      "Lady Gaga as Harleen \"Lee\" Quinzel, a patient at Arkham State Hospital who becomes obsessed with Arthur and forms a deadly romantic relationship with him.[10][11] Describing Quinzel, Phillips noted how this version of the character is manipulative, amoral and \"more grounded\", with the film deliberately ignoring much of the character's classic mannerisms and style to fit into the world created in Joker (2019).[12]\n",
      "Brendan Gleeson as Jackie Sullivan, an abusive guard at Arkham State Hospital.[13]\n",
      "Catherine Keener as Maryanne Stewart, Arthur's lawyer.[14]\n",
      "Zazie Beetz as Sophie Dumond, a single mother and Arthur's former neighbor, whom Arthur imagined being in a romantic relationship with.[15]\n",
      "Steve Coogan as Paddy Meyers, a popular TV personality who interviews Arthur in Arkham.[14]\n",
      "Harry Lawtey as Harvey Dent, the newly elected assistant district attorney who plans to bring Arthur to justice for his crimes.[16] Lawtey developed his own backstory for the character in order to accurately play the role, with Phillips instilling in him the idea that, in the dawn of televised trials, Dent has his eyes on the prize and is cynically willing to put Arthur on trial for his own gain. To prepare for the role, Lawtey avoided watching the versions of Harvey Dent in Batman (1989), Batman Forever (1995), The Dark Knight (2008) and Batman vs. Two-Face (2017) portrayed by Billy Dee Williams, Tommy Lee Jones, Aaron Eckhart and William Shatner respectively.[17][18]\n",
      "Leigh Gill as Gary Puddles, Arthur's former clown co-worker whose life he spared.[19]\n",
      "Ken Leung as Dr. Victor Liu, a psychologist who gives his testimony diagnosing Arthur at the trial.[20]\n",
      "Jacob Lofland as Ricky Meline, an inmate at Arkham who admires Arthur.[21]\n",
      "Bill Smitrovich as Judge Herman Rothwax, who presides over Arthur's trial.[22]\n",
      "Sharon Washington as Debra Kane, Arthur's former social worker.[23]\n",
      "Additionally, Connor Storrie appears as a young Arkham inmate who has a violent encounter with Arthur,[24][25] Tim Dillon appears as an Arkham Asylum guard who asks Arthur to sign his book, Marc Maron's likeness as Gene Ufland is used for the book and archive footage of Robert De Niro as Murray Franklin is used.\n",

      "Production[edit]\n",
      "Development[edit]\n",
      "Joker (2019) was intended to be a standalone film.[26] Warner Bros. intended for it to launch DC Black, a line of DC Comics-based films unrelated to the DC Extended Universe (DCEU) franchise with darker, more experimental material, similar to the DC Black Label comics publisher.[27][28][29] However, even before the film wrapped, Joaquin Phoenix told director Todd Phillips that he didn't feel ready to leave Arthur Fleck behind; one night while falling asleep, Phoenix had a dream of his character performing onstage, telling jokes and singing, giving him the idea of possibly doing a musical sequel.[12] While Phillips said in August 2019 that he would be interested in making a sequel, depending on the film's performance and if Phoenix was interested,[30] he later clarified that \"the movie's not set up to [have] a sequel. We always pitched it as one movie, and that's it.\"[31]\n",
      "In October 2019, Phoenix spoke of reprising his role as Arthur Fleck, saying: \"I can't stop thinking about it... if there's something else, we can do with Joker that might be interesting.\"[32] In another interview, he said: \"It's nothing that I really wanted to do prior to working on this movie. I don't know that there is [more to do] ... Because it seemed endless, the possibilities of where we can go with the character.\"[33] He was paid $20 million for his involvement.[34] As the film went on to earn more than $1 billion, Phoenix and Phillips thought about a possible follow-up in the form of a Broadway theatre show. They did not consider making a conventional sequel depicting Arthur's development into Batman's nemesis by turning him into the Clown Prince of Crime or putting him in charge of a criminal syndicate, despite the original film's depiction of the murder of Bruce Wayne's parents. Phillips preferred to focus on how Arthur's breakdown captivated Gotham, being interested in examining how the very idea of entertainment went from movies and television to whatever scandal the news currently air.[12]\n",
      "In November 2019, The Hollywood Reporter reported that a sequel was in development, with Phillips, writer Scott Silver and Phoenix reprising their duties.[35] However, Deadline Hollywood reported the same day that The Hollywood Reporter's story was false and that negotiations had not even begun.[36] Phillips responded to the reports by saying that he had discussed a sequel with Warner Bros., and it remained a possibility, but it was not in development.[37] Phillips and Phoenix started seriously considering the idea of making a Broadway sequel show to Joker at the Carlisle Theatre. After the original plans were changed by the COVID-19 pandemic, Phillips and Silver began developing a sequel while still considering Phoenix's musical concept. Phillips found the idea risky and \"dangerous\" enough to give the film \"audacity and complexity\" with music, dance, drama, courtroom drama, comedy, happiness and sadness and a traditional love story. Aware that young moviegoers may not be interested due to preferring usual comic book films, Phillips banked on their \"appetite\" for something new and different to help the film differentiate itself from remakes and reboots. Phoenix suggested the idea of teaming Arthur with a \"female Joker\" that could serve as his dance partner in a \"kind of psychotic tango\". This led Phillips and Silver to the idea of including Harley Quinn, a female villain associated with the Joker and first introduced in Batman: The Animated Series, to serve that purpose.[12]\n",
      "In June 2022, Phillips announced that the sequel was in development, with a script by him and Silver. The film was also revealed to be titled Joker: Folie à Deux.[38][39] By February 2023, DC Films CEO James Gunn confirmed that Folie à Deux would be a DC Elseworlds project, taking place outside the main cinematic DC Universe (DCU).[c][42] Phillips' goal for the film was to make it feel like it had been produced by \"crazy people\", but struggled with referring to the film as a \"musical\", as the film lacks traditional musical numbers, and most of the music contains dialogue, with songs like \"Get Happy\", \"For Once in My Life\" and \"That's Life\" being played when Arthur cannot pronounce the words he wants to say, with those songs conveying the emotions Arthur Fleck and Harley Quinn feel with what they seek in their relationships, with the former being drawn to romantic ballads and the latter preferring music about power.[12]\n",
      "On July 25, 2024, in an exclusive cover story for Empire, Lady Gaga commented on the singing required of her: \"It was unlike anything I've ever done before. [...] For me, there's plenty of notes, actually, from Lee. I'm a trained singer, right? So even my breathing was different when I sang as Lee. When I breathe to sing on stage, I have this very controlled way to make sure that I'm on pitch and it's sustained at the right rhythm and amount of time, but Lee would never know how to do any of that. So, it's like removing the technicality of the whole thing, removing my perceived art-form from it all and completely being inside of who she is.\" Phillips also said of this specific interpretation of the character, \"While there are some things that people would find familiar in her, it's really Gaga's own interpretation, and Scott [Silver, co-writer] and I's interpretation. She became the way how Manson had girls that idolized him. The way that sometimes these [imprisoned murderers] have people that look up to them. There are things about Harley in the movie that were taken from the comic books, but we took it and made it to the way we wanted it to be.\"[43][44][45][46] Despite Gaga and Phoenix showing off their musical skills in past projects, Phillips did not require them to sing professionally, preferring a \"rawer, more unstable sound\" that fluctuated between euphoria and despair, which occasionally required singing off-key. The filmmakers asked themselves what needed to happen for two individuals to break into song in the middle of a conversation and where the music could come from when no one but the protagonists can hear it. They rationalized that the main characters are not, or should sound like, professional singers with vibrato and perfect notes, instead sounding \"nerve-racking but honest\".[12]\n",
      "On August 20, 2024, an exclusive cover story for Variety revealed that the film would open with a Looney Tunes-inspired cartoon animated by The Triplets of Belleville animator Sylvain Chomet, which would be followed by prison riots, courtroom legal fights and a variety show sequence that has Phoenix and Gaga portrayed as a homicidal Sonny & Cher.[12]\n",
      "\n",
      "Casting[edit]\n",
      "Days after the film's official announcement, it was announced Gaga was in talks to portray Harley Quinn and that the film would be a musical.[47][48] Gaga would confirm her casting later that summer.[49] She received $12 million for her involvement.[3] In August 2022, it was reported Zazie Beetz was in negotiations to reprise her role as Sophie Dumond in the film.[50] Beetz was confirmed to be reprising her role the following month, alongside the cast additions of Brendan Gleeson, Catherine Keener and Jacob Lofland.[15][51][21] Gleeson joined the project out of his admiration for both Phoenix's \"indelible\" performance in the first film and Gaga, but admitted to being \"kinda intimidated\" by what he had to do for his role.[52] In October, Harry Lawtey joined the cast in what Deadline Hollywood reported as a \"big role\",[18] later revealed to be that of Harvey Dent by the film's official trailer.[16] Lawtey taped an audition for Phillips, consisting of a recorded self-talk between himself and a friend of his, just as HBO renewed Industry (2020-present) in Fall 2022, not expecting to get the role, for which he had no information. A couple of weeks later, Lawtey had a Zoom call with Phillips, during which he offered him the role of Dent straight away even though his team assumed it was going to be a note session for a second read.[17]\n",

      "Filming[edit]\n",
      "The abandoned Essex County Isolation Hospital in New Jersey (pictured in March 2023, with vintage cars and props) served as a filming location for Arkham State Hospital\n",
      "Principal photography began on December 10, 2022, with Phillips releasing a first look on his Instagram account and Lawrence Sher serving as cinematographer.[53][54] Sher had cited Francis Ford Coppola's One from the Heart (1982) as a source of visual inspiration for the film.[55] Exterior filming occurred in New York City and Los Angeles by March 2023.[56] Gaga had filmed scenes with a crowd of extras demanding Joker's arrest outside the New York County Courthouse, which had led some onlookers nearby to mistake it for Trump's arrest following his first indictment.[57] Arkham Asylum scenes were filmed at the abandoned Essex County Isolation Hospital in Belleville, New Jersey.[58] In April 2023, filming took place at the \"Joker Stairs\", the stairway on West 167th Street in the Bronx featured prominently in the first film.[59] Filming officially wrapped on April 5, 2023.[60] The film is shot entirely with IMAX-certified digital cameras, including the Arri Alexa 65, the same camera used in filming for Joker.[61]\n",
      "Unlike many musicals that have actors sing along to a pre-recorded track, Phoenix and Gaga performed the musical numbers live, accompanied by a piano player who performed off-camera keeping up with whatever tempo they established. Meanwhile, Phillips tried to sync the radically different takes into a coherent whole in the editing room, describing the experience as a \"nightmare\".[12]\n",
      "\n",
      "Post-production[edit]\n",
      "In December 2023, Gunn revealed he reviewed shot material and gave his notes regarding it, but had no involvement with the film otherwise. The film was also not test screened in advance. [62] The film was \"much more expensive\" than its predecessor, which had a budget of around $60 million, with some publications noting the costs as high as $200 million, though Phillips denied that figure.[3][2][12]\n",
      "Industrial Light & Magic provided the visual effects for the film.[63]\n",
      "\n",
      "Music[edit]\n",
      "Main articles: Joker: Folie à Deux (soundtrack) and Joker: Folie à Deux (score)\n",
      "Hildur Guðnadóttir composed the film's score, returning from the first film.[64] The film is expected to include at least 15 musical numbers, most of them covers of pre-existing songs, with an opportunity to also feature one or two original songs; these songs will incorporate elements of Guðnadóttir's score.[65] Gaga released a \"companion album\", Harlequin, on September 27, 2024.[66]\n",
      "\n",
      "Marketing[edit]\n",
      "A teaser trailer for the film was released on April 10, 2024, while Warner Bros. screened a presentation at the 2024 CinemaCon, being promoted by Phillips. It features Sammy Davis Jr. and Tom Jones' cover of the song \"What the World Needs Now Is Love\" (1965). Christi Carras from Los Angeles Times felt the film's presentation as a musical adhered to a trend where movie studios seemed reluctant to promote their films as musicals, citing Wonka (2023) and Mean Girls (2024) as examples.[67] Writing for Variety, Rebecca Rubin called the footage \"dark and gritty\" and highlighted the portrayal of Quinn as being Fleck's \"demented muse\".[68] TheWrap's Jeremy Fuster and Stephanie Kaloi described the trailer as focusing on Quinn and Fleck's \"wild, destructive love\".[69] The trailer gained 167 million views in 24 hours, being Warner Bros.' biggest trailer premiere at the time, having surpassed that of the first trailer for Barbie (2023).[70]\n",
      "\n",
      "Release[edit]\n",
      "Joker: Folie à Deux had the world premiere at the 81st Venice International Film Festival on September 4, 2024.[8] The film was released theatrically in the United States on October 4, 2024, by Warner Bros. Pictures.[39] At their 2024 CineEurope presentation, Warner Bros. announced that the film would be released overseas on October 2, 2024, two days before the domestic premiere.[71] The film was released on IMAX screens, when Megalopolis (2024) relinquished them a week after its own release.[72]\n",
      "Following the success of Oppenheimer and Dune: Part Two in the format, Joker: Folie à Deux was released in the IMAX 15-perforation 70 mm film format to eleven venues worldwide.[73][74] In October 2024, Phillips said he had no plans to make further DC films.[75] The film was also released in 70mm IMAX screens in select theaters.[76]\n",
      "\n",
      "Reception[edit]\n",
      "Box office[edit]\n",
      "As of October 6, 2024[update], Joker: Folie à Deux has grossed $40 million in the United States and Canada, and $81.1 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $121.1 million.[4][5] Variety estimated that the film would need to gross $450 million to break even, due to its budget of $200 million.[77]\n",
      "Five weeks ahead of release, Boxoffice Pro projected that the film would \"easily\" gross at least $100 million in its opening weekend in the United States and Canada and outgross its predecessor's debut of $96.2 million, with estimates at $115–145 million despite it receiving mixed reviews at Venice like its predecessor.[78] Two weeks after, projections dropped to $70 million, and the week of release, estimates became $55–60 million.[79][2] After the film made $20 million on its first day, including an estimated $7 million from Thursday night previews, projections dropped again to $45 million for the weekend. It went on to debut at $40 million, topping the box office but coming below expectations. Deadline Hollywood attributed the opening to fans of the original not wanting to see a musical.[80]\n",
      "\n",
      "Critical response[edit]\n",
      "Publications described the critical consensus upon Folie à Deux's release as either mixed[d] or negative.[e] On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 33% of 266 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Joaquin Phoenix's eponymous Joker takes the stand in a sequel that dances around while the story remains still, although Lady Gaga's wildcard energy gives Folie à Deux some verve.\"[91] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 45 out of 100, based on 57 critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews.[92] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"D\" on an A+ to F scale (down from the first film's \"B+\" as well as the lowest grade ever for a comic book film),[93][94] while those surveyed by PostTrak gave the film a 40% overall positive score (with an average 1/2 out of five star rating), with \"a very low\" 24% saying they would definitely recommend it.[80]\n",
      "Pete Hammond of Deadline Hollywood felt the film was \"brilliant\", while also commenting that the \"production values across the board are excellent, particularly returning Lawrence Sher's cinematography, the production design of Mark Friedberg, and costumes from Arianna Phillips.\"[95] William Bibbiani of TheWrap gave the film a positive review, writing that the film \"is the most interesting film about Arthur Fleck. It's genuinely a little daring, genuinely a little challenging, and genuinely a little genuine.\"[96] Geoffrey Macnab of Independent described the film as \"deeply unsettling\".[97] In his four stars out of five review for The Daily Telegraph, Robbie Collin lauded the film for its musical numbers and Phillips for \"stay[ing] true to the project’s nihilistic ethos,\" while noting Lady Gaga was \"magnetic but underused.\"[98] Rafa Sales Ross of The Playlist echoed similar thoughts on the use of Gaga, but praised Phillips for his \"course correction in catering to radical misogynists\" and enjoyed Phoenix \"in a much more contained turn, a welcome change to those put off by the constant, annoyingly loud cackling that permeated much of the previous instalment.\"[99]\n",
      "In his three stars out of five review for The Guardian, Peter Bradshaw praised the opening, the supporting cast and the \"real spark\" in the first encounter between the two protagonists, but wrote \"the whole movie finally turns out to be oppressively, claustrophobically and repetitively becalmed in that oddly unreal Gotham-universe jail with Phoenix and Gaga kept apart for long periods\". Bradshaw found that \"Phoenix's own performance is as single-note as before, though certainly as forceful and his screen presence is potent\" and that Gaga \"brings a sly and manipulative malice\" to her character.[100] In a mixed review for KQED-FM, Jack Coyle wrote, \"laudable as the intentions of Folie à Deux may be, it feels thoughtfully but tiresomely stuck in the past.\"[101] A negative review for ABC News by Luke Goodsell wrote: \"That Joker was intended as a standalone movie is evident from the new sequel ... a quasi-musical courtroom drama that has little interest in advancing any kind of story. In fact, it's even more deliberately obtuse and anti-crowd-pleasing than its predecessor.\"[102]\n",
      "USA Today reported that the negative reviews \"argued the musical numbers are underwhelming and Gaga's talents are not well-utilized\".[83] Manohla Dargis of The New York Times stated the film was \"such a dour, unpleasant slog that it is hard to know why it was made or for whom,\" and that \"Phoenix's sour frown, the movie's barely-there story, its unrelenting grimness and its commitment to forced eccentricity suggest that no one involved was really stoked to make it.\"[103] David Ehrlich of IndieWire gave a scathing review, stating the film \"perversely denies audiences everything they've been conditioned to want from it; gently at first, and then later with the unmistakable hostility of a knife to the gut,\" and that \"its turgid symphony of unexpected cameos, mournful cello solos, and implied sexual violence is too dissonant to appreciate even on its own terms.\"[104] Spencer Kornhaber of The Atlantic lamented that the film has \"nothing interesting to say about the challenge of fame\" and feels like \"punish[ment] for the crime of wanting to be entertained.\"[105] Justin Clark of Slant Magazine gave the film one out of four, writing that \"Folie à Deux's attempt at showcasing cleverness, verve, or engagement is held cruelly underwater by staid direction, shoddy emotional plotting, a gleeful sense of cruelty, and a grave nihilism that makes Zack Snyder's work seem like a season of Bluey\".[106] David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter found the film \"frustrating,\" its plot \"a little thin and at times dull,\" and took issue with how the film \"all but neutralizes [the Joker]\" and \"reduces the archvillain to a hollowed-out product of childhood trauma and mental illness.\"[107] Owen Gleiberman of Variety also criticized its thin plot, deeming it \"overly cautious\" and lacking in execution, while taking issue with the minimal use of Gaga, noting her \"lovely unforced presence\" in the film \"is drastically underused. Her Lee never quite takes wing.\"[108]\n",
      "\n",
      "Themes and analysis[edit]\n",
      "Critics noted that the film was a work of metafiction, designed to intentionally antagonize audiences who were fans of the first film. Rather than capitulating to expectations of the predecessor's fanbase, the film serves to rebuke those who idolized the character of the Joker after the original movie. As a deliberate anti-audience effort, the film pushes against the notion of fan service, instead creating a self-aware narrative that is a commentary on its own existence.[109][110][111][112][113] The film features off-key musical sequences that contrast with fan expectations following the original film, during one such scene Joker acknowledges, \"I don't think we're giving the people what they want\".[109] Gaga's portrayal of Lee Quinzel can be viewed as a stand-in for audiences who were fans of the first film, with her comments about becoming obsessed with Arthur after having seen a TV movie based on his life reflecting the audience.[112][113] The finale where Arthur's crimes are trialed and he is made to seem sad and pathetic represents an effort by Phillips to subvert and undermine audiences who saw Arthur as heroic in the first film,[111][113] and the trial reiterates the events of the first film in a way that is intended to be dissatisfying and alienating to audiences.[114][115]\n",
